# ATM Machine

## What Will The Application Do?
This application will closely resemble an **ATM Machine**. The user will
be able to
- Create an **account**
- **Suspend** an account
- Have multiple **account types** such as chequing and savings
- **Deposit** money into an account they choose
- **Withdraw** money from an account

## Who Will Use It?
Anybody will be able to use this application as long as they wish to 
create a ***banking*** account or already have one. Someone that wishes
to have an easy access and user-friendly ATM at their fingertips will
use this banking application. Also, it would a good introduction to 
banking for those who are new to the era of bank accounts.

## Why Is This Project Of Interest To You?
This project intrigues me because I am quite *lazy* when it comes to
going to the bank. Especially, when the only reason I am going is to use
the ATM. I find that it would be useful to have access to an ATM whenever
because there are still many uses for physical cash. Also, I believe that
the typical person would not want to wander around with $200 or more in
cash. Also, I am interested to create a new and improved ATM that has 
more features and is easier to use than normal ATMs you see at everyday
banks.
